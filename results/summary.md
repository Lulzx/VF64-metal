against Berkeley TestFloat/SoftFloat with zero unexplained mismatches.

Covered operations:

- add, subtract, multiply, and divide: 46,464 cases per rounding mode;
- square root: 768 cases per rounding mode;
- true fused FMA: 6,133,248 cases per rounding mode;
- five IEEE rounding directions for every operation.

This is result-bit conformance with NaNs compared by class. It does not claim
M2 exception-flag, signaling-NaN, or payload conformance.
